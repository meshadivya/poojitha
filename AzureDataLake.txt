# 1. Types of Storage Accounts
# Azure Blob Storage:
1. Object Storage: Designed for storing and serving unstructured data, such as images, videos, and files.
2. Hot, Cool, and Archive Tiers: Optimize storage costs based on data access patterns.
3. Data Lake-like Features: Supports some data lake features, such as hierarchical namespaces and data tiering.

# Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) Gen2:
1. Data Lake Storage: Designed for big data analytics, machine learning, and data science workloads.
2. Hierarchical Namespace: Organize files and folders in a hierarchical structure, similar to a file system.
3. High-performance: Optimized for high-throughput and low-latency data access.
4. Data Governance: Supports robust data governance features, such as POSIX permissions and access control lists (ACLs).

#differences 
Hierarchial namespacing is not allowed in blob storage whereas it is enabled in adls gen2.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 3. Access Tiers
- Hot storage: Frequently accessed data, optimized for low latency and high throughput.
- Cool storage: Infrequently accessed data, optimized for lower storage costs.
- Archive storage: Rarely accessed data, optimized for lowest storage costs.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 4. Data Replication Policies
- Locally redundant storage (LRS): Data replicated within a single data center.
- Zone-redundant storage (ZRS): Data replicated across multiple data centers within a region.
- Geo-redundant storage (GRS): Data replicated across multiple regions.
- Geo-zone-redundant storage (GZRS): Data replicated across multiple regions and zones.

--DATA CENTER-
A data center is a centralized facility used to store, manage, and disseminate large amounts of data and applications.
It's essentially a massive warehouse filled with servers, storage systems, networking equipment, and other IT infrastructure.

#COMPLIANCE IN ADLS GEN2-

Compliance in Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) Gen2 is crucial for ensuring the security, integrity, and regulatory compliance of your data. Here are some key compliance features and considerations:

Compliance Features:
1. POSIX Permissions: ADLS Gen2 supports POSIX permissions, enabling fine-grained access control and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements.
2. Access Control Lists (ACLs): ACLs provide an additional layer of access control, allowing you to define permissions for users, groups, and services.
3. Encryption: ADLS Gen2 supports server-side encryption (SSE) and client-side encryption, ensuring data is protected both in transit and at rest.
4. Data Masking: ADLS Gen2 provides data masking capabilities, enabling you to protect sensitive data and comply with regulations like GDPR and HIPAA.
5. Auditing and Logging: ADLS Gen2 provides auditing and logging capabilities, enabling you to track data access, modifications, and deletions.

Regulatory Compliance:
1. GDPR: ADLS Gen2 provides features to support GDPR compliance, including data masking, encryption, and access controls.
2. HIPAA: ADLS Gen2 supports HIPAA compliance, with features like encryption, access controls, and auditing.
3. PCI-DSS: ADLS Gen2 provides features to support PCI-DSS compliance, including encryption, access controls, and auditing.
4. SOC 2: ADLS Gen2 supports SOC 2 compliance, with features like auditing, logging, and access controls.

Compliance Considerations:
1. Data Classification: Classify your data to ensure it's stored and processed in accordance with regulatory requirements.
2. Access Controls: Implement robust access controls, including POSIX permissions and ACLs, to ensure only authorized users can access data.
3. Data Encryption: Use encryption to protect data both in transit and at rest.
4. Auditing and Logging: Regularly review auditing and logging data to detect and respond to security incidents.
5. Compliance Monitoring: Continuously monitor your ADLS Gen2 environment for compliance with regulatory requirements.

HOW DATA IS STORED IN ADLS GEN2-

In Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) Gen2, data is stored in a hierarchical namespace, similar to a file system. Here's an overview of how data is stored:

Storage Components:
1. Containers: Top-level storage components that hold folders and files.
2. Folders: Logical groupings of files and subfolders.
3. Files: Individual data objects stored in ADLS Gen2.

Data Storage:
1. Block Blobs: ADLS Gen2 stores data as block blobs, which are optimized for large, unstructured data sets.
2. Block Size: Each block blob is divided into fixed-size blocks (default is 256 MB).
3. Data Compression: ADLS Gen2 supports compression, which reduces storage costs and improves data transfer efficiency.
4. Data Encryption: ADLS Gen2 encrypts data at rest and in transit using server-side encryption (SSE) and client-side encryption.

File System Structure:
1. Hierarchical Namespace: ADLS Gen2 uses a hierarchical namespace, similar to a file system.
2. Path: Files and folders are addressed using a path, which includes the container, folder, and file name.
3. File System Operations: ADLS Gen2 supports standard file system operations, such as create, read, update, and delete.

Data Management:
1. Data Versioning: ADLS Gen2 supports data versioning, which allows you to track changes to files over time.
2. Data Retention: ADLS Gen2 provides data retention policies, which enable you to manage data lifecycle and compliance requirements.
3. Data Discovery: ADLS Gen2 supports data discovery, which allows you to search and find data across your storage account.
